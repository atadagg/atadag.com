# What Are Organizations and How to Automate Them?

## Introduction

Organizations are the building blocks of our social, economic, and political life. From nations to corporations to community groups, humans have long formed organized groups to pursue shared goals. But traditional organizations often concentrate power at the top, leading to structures that can resemble autocratic governments. 

This essay explores what fundamentally defines an organization, why a company can be seen as structurally similar to a state, and how alternative models like cooperatives offer a more people-centered approach. We will critique current hierarchical forms that centralize authority and suppress genuine consent, identify the key obstacles preventing fair and democratic organization, and then propose how emerging technologies – from AI to digital governance tools – can help overcome these obstacles. 

Finally, we envision a future of fully autonomous, self-governing organizations that truly serve human needs (grounded in real-world possibilities, not just blockchain buzzwords). Throughout, we'll draw on historical context, philosophical insights, and practical examples (such as the ScrapeForge and Fidelio cooperative initiatives) to illustrate a path toward more just and automated organizations.

## What Defines an Organization, and Why a Company Is Like a State

At its core, an organization is a structured group of people working together toward common objectives. Classic definitions emphasize that an organization is "a social unit of people structured and managed to meet a need or pursue collective goals." In any organization, individuals assume different roles and functions, and these functions must be coordinated to achieve the group's purpose. 

Crucially, the organization exists beyond the participation of any single individual – members may come and go, but the structured group endures. This continuity is maintained through rules, norms, and governance mechanisms that guide behavior and decision-making within the group.

Given these features, companies and states share surprising structural similarities. Both are organizations that govern groups of people (employees or citizens) through rules and authority. A company's internal policies, management hierarchy, and governing board parallel a state's laws, government branches, and political leadership. 

In fact, a compelling way to understand corporations is as "private governments" that wield power over people's lives much like public governments do. Philosopher Elizabeth Anderson famously noted that we often forget how most of us "are governed far more—and more obtrusively—by the private government of the workplace" than by our democratic states.

Within a company, executives and managers issue commands, enforce policies, and even set "laws" (company rules) that employees must follow. The CEO and board in a corporation function much like the executive and legislature of a state, establishing directives and policies. Employees, much like citizens, are expected to comply. But unlike citizens in a democracy, employees typically have little say in choosing their leaders or shaping the rules.

Historically, corporations were creatures of the state – chartered by governments – but over time they have grown into powerful entities governing their internal affairs. The relationship is so close that some political scientists argue we live in a "corporate state," where state power and corporate power are deeply intertwined.

Just as states grant rights and legal personality to corporations, companies create their own internal "constitutions" (bylaws and policies) to govern themselves. Moreover, large corporations today can influence laws and regulations, blurring the line between public and private governance.

Perhaps the most striking similarity is the question of legitimacy and consent. Modern democratic states claim legitimacy through the consent of the governed (e.g. citizens vote for leaders and laws). Yet companies, which govern many aspects of employees' lives, are usually not democratic internally. Political theorists like Robert Dahl have pointed out this anomaly: we believe in democracy for government, but accept authoritarian rule in the workplace.

Employees might consent only in the limited sense of choosing to take a job or quit – but once inside the firm, they have no voting rights over their "rulers." This has led thinkers like Noam Chomsky to describe corporations as "private tyrannies", noting that a corporation's structure "is about as close to the totalitarian model as anything human beings have created," with control flowing strictly top-down.

In other words, corporations often operate like autocratic mini-states: managers govern and workers obey. The analogy is so apt that one in four American workers says their workplace is a "dictatorship," and that number would likely be higher if more people recognized how much authority employers wield.

In summary, an organization is defined by coordinated collective effort and a governance structure – and in companies this structure mirrors that of a state, albeit typically an undemocratic one. Understanding this parallel is important, because it highlights why issues of power, rights, and justice in organizations are fundamentally political. If a company is like a state, then questions of how power is distributed in companies (and who gets to make decisions) are as critical as they are in any government. This sets the stage for exploring alternatives that make organizations more just and democratic, as we do next with cooperatives.

## Cooperatives: People-Centered Organizations for Justice

If traditional firms concentrate power at the top, cooperatives represent a different design: they are organizations owned and governed by the very people they serve. A cooperative (co-op) is essentially an enterprise where members collectively control decisions and share in the proceeds. By design, cooperatives aim to be more equitable and people-centered.

According to the International Cooperative Alliance, "Cooperatives are people-centered enterprises owned, controlled and run by and for their members to realize their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations."

In practical terms, this means the members of a co-op – whether they are workers, consumers, or residents – democratically manage the organization on the basis of one-member-one-vote, rather than one-share-one-vote as in a corporation. Each person has an equal say, regardless of how much capital they contributed or what role they play. This structural difference makes cooperatives inherently more just in distributing power.

The role and design of cooperatives prioritize human needs over maximizing profits for outside investors. In a worker cooperative, for example, the employees collectively own the business and elect their management or make decisions together in assemblies. This aligns the organization's purpose with workers' well-being – profit is a means to an end (sustaining jobs and community) rather than an end in itself.

In consumer cooperatives (like co-op grocery stores), the customers/members vote on policies and sometimes even on prices or product choices, ensuring the business serves its customers' interests rather than exploiting them. In all cases, co-ops try to ground economic activity in consent and participation: those affected by decisions are the ones who have authority to make them.

### Historical Context

Historically, cooperatives emerged as a response to the injustices of the Industrial Revolution. The early cooperative movement in the 19th century (such as the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 1844 England) set out principles of democratic governance, equitable contribution and distribution, and community benefit that still guide co-ops today. 

These principles include:
- Voluntary open membership
- Democratic member control
- Member economic participation (sharing profits)
- Autonomy and independence
- Education and training
- Cooperation among cooperatives
- Concern for community

Such values explicitly inject social justice into the organizational DNA. For instance, co-ops often implement pay equity (narrow gaps between highest and lowest earners), transparency in accounting, and mechanisms for resolving conflicts collectively. They can be seen as an effort to "civilize" or democratize the economy by infusing business with the same egalitarian norms we expect in political democracy.

Cooperatives also demonstrate that organizations can be effective without top-down control. The Mondragon Corporation in Spain – one of the world's largest federations of worker cooperatives – has prospered for decades with a democratically governed structure involving tens of thousands of worker-owners. Mondragon's success, along with many credit unions, mutual insurance companies, rural electric co-ops, and other examples, show that people-centered organizations can compete with conventional firms while providing greater fairness and member satisfaction.

Studies have even indicated that worker cooperatives can be as productive as, or more productive than, comparable traditional companies, partly because members are more motivated when they have a stake and a voice in the enterprise.

Most importantly, co-ops return agency and dignity to participants. Instead of being subject to "private government" by bosses, co-op members are the government. The cooperative model thus addresses the critique of the company-as-state: it transforms the dictatorship of the workplace into a micro-democracy. A cooperative enterprise is structurally similar to a republic rather than a monarchy – leadership may be appointed or elected, but leaders are accountable to the members and can be replaced through due process.

In a cooperative, power is intentionally decentralized and shared, which makes it a more just organization by design. Of course, cooperatives are not a panacea. They face challenges such as raising capital (since they can't easily sell control to outside investors without undermining member ownership) and making decisions efficiently as they grow large. However, their people-centered ethos offers a template for fairness that is absent in many corporate structures.

Cooperatives remind us that consent of the governed can be built into an organization's structure. They are living examples that another way is possible – one where organizations exist to serve people, rather than people serving organizations.

## Centralized Power and the Suppression of Consent in Traditional Organizations

Many mainstream organizations – especially large corporations, but also governments, universities, and even nonprofits – suffer from excessive centralization of power. Decision-making authority in these structures is concentrated in a small leadership group at the top of a hierarchy. The further down the rank-and-file, the less say individuals have. This section critiques how such top-down organizational forms can become authoritarian, often suppressing the consent and input of the majority of their members (employees, lower managers, etc.).

In a typical corporation, a handful of executives and board members set strategy, allocate resources, and determine policies; managers transmit orders downward; everyone else follows instructions or faces exit (being fired or quitting). There is usually no requirement that policies be approved by the workers who carry them out, nor any mechanism for employees to veto decisions that profoundly affect them (short of whistleblowing or mass resignation). Consent is assumed through the act of employment, a dangerously thin basis for legitimizing what is often sweeping control over workers' time and behavior.

As economist Albert Hirschman noted, dissatisfied members of an organization generally have two options: "exit" or "voice." They can either leave the organization or speak up to try to change it. In traditional firms, true "voice" is minimal – there is no formal vote on most decisions – so workers effectively are left only with the option to exit if they disagree. But exit (quitting) can be costly or impractical, which means many people are trapped under policies they do not consent to. This dynamic is akin to a citizen under an authoritarian regime: in theory they can emigrate, but in practice they lack voice and leaving may not be a real choice.

Furthermore, hierarchical organizations often suppress dissent and feedback. Even well-intentioned managers can create an environment where questioning the boss is career suicide. Dissenting voices are filtered out as information travels upward, a phenomenon sometimes called the "mum effect" or simply organizational silence. The result is that the people at the top may be unaware of problems or ideas bubbling at the grassroots, and people at the bottom feel disempowered and alienated. Over time, a culture of compliance takes hold, reinforcing the power structure.

Political theorist Roberto Michels described this tendency in his "iron law of oligarchy," observing that even organizations formed to be democratic can end up dominated by a few leaders, as hierarchy and bureaucracy gradually solidify control in their hands. Centralized power also tends to perpetuate itself. Leaders with concentrated authority may hoard power, consciously or unconsciously suppressing systems that would distribute decision-making. Why? Because giving others a voice can feel like a loss of control or a threat to one's position.

In extreme cases, charismatic founders or CEOs become single points of failure – their personal vision (or whims) override any collective deliberation. Scandals and failures in corporations (or even nations) often trace back to unaccountable leaders making decisions in isolation, without broad consent or transparency.

An example of consent suppression is the recent trend of some tech companies banning employee discussion of political or social issues at work. One CEO infamously declared that the company is not a democracy and that employees should focus only on work, effectively telling them to "leave your voice at the door." This underscores how the default corporate stance is often that workers' rights to have a say stops at the workplace gate. As one commentator quipped, many firms are happy to extol freedom and democracy as societal values while internally operating like mini-autocracies.

The critique of such organizational forms is not just moral but also practical. When consent and input are suppressed, organizations can make poorer decisions. They fail to tap the collective intelligence of their members and may breed resentment or apathy that undercuts performance. A growing body of research and business literature argues that empowering employees leads to better outcomes – more innovation, faster problem-solving, higher engagement. This is why some companies are experimenting with flatter structures or participatory management. But these remain exceptions; by and large, the traditional top-down model persists from the factory floor to the Fortune 500 boardroom.

In summary, current organizational forms that centralize power are prone to authoritarian dynamics. They treat consent as a one-time transaction (you agreed to the job, so you agree to whatever we decide) rather than an ongoing, active process. They often silence the governed rather than seek their counsel. This centralization and suppression of consent is a fundamental flaw – one that not only offends democratic ideals but can also hamper organizational effectiveness. To build more just organizations, we must directly address the reasons why this model prevails and examine how to change it.

## Obstacles to Just Organization: Power, Information, Coordination, and Exit

Why haven't democratic, people-driven organizations become the norm? Several obstructions impede the creation of more just and participatory organizations. It's important to understand these obstacles if we want to overcome them. Key barriers include power hoarding, information asymmetry, coordination costs, and limitations on exit. Below we unpack each of these challenges:

### Power Hoarding

Once individuals or factions gain power within an organization, they often seek to retain and expand it. This is a classic human (and institutional) behavior – those at the top are reluctant to dilute their authority. They may genuinely believe that central control is needed for efficiency, or they may enjoy the privileges of power (higher pay, prestige, security) and fear losing them. The result is an internal resistance to structures that democratize decision-making.

For example, a manager might resist forming a worker council with real decision power, perceiving it as a threat to their role. Power hoarding also manifests in leaders surrounding themselves with yes-men and grooming successors who will maintain the status quo. This entrenched elite layer makes it difficult for bottom-up governance to take root.

### Information Asymmetry

In hierarchical organizations, knowledge is often concentrated at the top. Executives have access to comprehensive data about the business, or the "big picture" strategy, while lower-level employees see only their narrow slice. This asymmetry can be by design – keeping information siloed or confidential is a way to prevent challenges to authority (e.g., only top leaders know the full financials or impending plans, so others can't question decisions effectively).

Even when not intentional, information naturally funnels upward in hierarchies, and what comes down may be limited or filtered. This imbalance of information makes genuine participation hard: how can employees meaningfully consent or contribute if they don't know what's really going on? Leaders then justify their monopoly on decision-making by saying "we have the context, others don't." It's a self-reinforcing cycle. Breaking it requires radical transparency so that information (and thus power) is shared widely, but many organizations are not set up for that openness.

### Coordination Costs

One practical reason hierarchy exists is that coordinating large groups can be very challenging. It's often quicker for a single authority to make a decision than to have many people deliberate and vote. Democratic processes can be time-consuming and unwieldy, especially if thousands of people are involved. The fear is that a more participatory organization might get bogged down in endless meetings or votes, losing agility.

Traditional organizations have solved this by creating clear chains of command – reducing the number of decision-makers and communication channels to speed up execution. However, this "efficiency" comes at the cost of excluding input. In the past, high coordination costs were a genuine obstacle to workplace democracy; without modern communications, having everyone involved in decisions was nearly impossible in a large firm. Today, technology can mitigate this (as we discuss later), but the perception of high coordination cost still leads many to default to hierarchical control. It's the common excuse: "Democracy is nice in theory, but we don't have time for it when running a business."

### Exit Limitations

The ability to leave an organization instead of putting up with injustice is supposed to keep organizations in check (in market theory, if a company treats workers poorly, workers will leave for a better employer, forcing change). In reality, exit is often limited by economic and social factors. People need incomes, have limited job options, or face personal constraints that make "just quit" a hollow retort.

If all firms in an industry have similar top-down structures, leaving one job may just mean entering another with the same issues. Moreover, there may be loyalty or cultural pressures that make people stay even in unfair conditions (Hirschman's third factor, "loyalty," can make people endure rather than exit or voice).

In the context of political states, exiting (emigrating) is even harder due to legal and practical barriers, which is why democracies value voice (voting, protest) over the unrealistic option that everyone unhappy should just leave. Similarly, in companies, lack of voice coupled with constrained exit means members are subject to governance without genuine consent. The threat of exit is not enough to discipline leadership when jobs are scarce or workers are easily replaceable. This dynamic allows unjust practices to persist.

These obstacles often interlock. Power hoarding creates information asymmetry (leaders keep knowledge to themselves), which justifies further power hoarding ("we know best"). Limited exit means discontent doesn't translate into organizational change, allowing high coordination barriers to remain unchallenged. Understanding these barriers helps us see why simply expecting organizations to become democratic on their own is naïve. It will likely require intentional redesign and new tools to overcome these structural issues. In the next section, we explore how emerging technologies and new organizational strategies could lower coordination costs, reduce information asymmetry, and provide alternatives to traditional power structures – essentially, how we might automate or re-engineer organizations to be more just.

## Using Automation to Overcome Organizational Barriers

Advances in technology – particularly in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital collaboration tools – provide new opportunities to restructure organizations in more democratic and efficient ways. The very obstacles that once necessitated hierarchy (information flow limits, coordination difficulties) can now be addressed with smart systems and platforms. In this section, we propose how automation and digital infrastructure can help circumvent the obstructions outlined above, enabling organizations that are both highly coordinated and highly participatory. The goal is to harness technology to flatten hierarchies, distribute knowledge, and empower members at scale.

### 1. Enhancing Transparency and Information Access

Modern information systems can break down the information asymmetry in organizations. Instead of knowledge being trapped in siloed reports to upper management, shared digital platforms (like internal wikis, dashboards, and AI-driven analytics accessible to all) can democratize data.

For example, imagine an AI system that gathers real-time metrics on a company's performance, projects, and external environment, and presents this information in an easily digestible form to every member of the organization. This could include financial data, customer feedback, project statuses, etc. – much of which today is seen only by managers.

By making information open and intelligible, employees anywhere in the hierarchy can understand the "big picture" and contribute meaningfully. AI can also help interpret complex data for the layperson, reducing the dependency on an elite of specialists. The result is a more informed workforce, eliminating the old excuse that only those at the top know enough to decide.

As one tech strategist noted, AI-driven communication tools can "facilitate direct, efficient, and timely communication across organizational boundaries, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and fostering a more open and democratic workplace culture." Such tools contribute to greater transparency and faster information flow.

### 2. Automating Routine Decisions and Coordination

A significant portion of "management" consists of routine tasks – scheduling, resource allocation, monitoring compliance, compiling reports. These are precisely the kind of tasks AI and software can handle. If we delegate repetitive decision-making to algorithms (under rules set democratically), we can dramatically reduce the need for middle managers who mainly transmit orders or track output.

In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2026, 20% of organizations will use AI to eliminate more than half of their current middle management positions, as AI takes over tasks like scheduling, reporting, and performance monitoring. This flattening of structure can cut labor costs and also cut the "telephone game" of instructions passing through layers. Instead, instructions and information can flow directly to those doing the work, mediated by software.

Automation can coordinate complex processes – for instance, algorithmic systems already manage supply chains and manufacturing flows more efficiently than hierarchical oversight did. The key is to design these algorithms to be servants of the collective, not new masters. In a just organization, AI would function like an impartial bureaucrat executing decisions that have been agreed upon by members, or optimizing within parameters members set.

By taking over drudgery and bureaucratic chores, automation frees humans to focus on creative, strategic, and interpersonal aspects of work, which require judgement, empathy, and consensus-building. This aligns with visions like Jeremy Rifkin's, where increasing automation allows flatter structures and more innovation.

### 3. Digital Platforms for Participatory Decision-Making

One of the most promising areas is the development of open governance tooling – digital platforms that allow large groups to discuss, propose, and decide on matters in an organized way. Early examples such as Loomio (created by a worker cooperative in New Zealand) have shown that software can enable inclusive decision-making without endless meetings.

Loomio's platform lets any member propose a course of action, facilitates discussion, and then people can vote or indicate agreement/disagreement asynchronously. Thousands of groups have used it to reach decisions with broad buy-in, bridging the gap between efficiency and engagement.

The designers of Loomio explicitly set out to overcome the old trade-off between having many voices and being able to act quickly: "the best decisions are made when everyone affected can participate... the flip side is considering many voices can be time-consuming – this is the excuse for top-down decisions ... Loomio is driven by the vision that it should be easy for anyone, anywhere to meaningfully participate in decisions that affect their lives."

Beyond Loomio, other tools exist or are emerging:
- pol.is for mass feedback and finding consensus in large crowds
- Liquid Democracy platforms that let people delegate votes issue-by-issue
- Various crowdsourcing systems for idea generation and deliberation

By using such tools, an organization can involve hundreds or thousands of members in governance in a structured, time-bound process. AI can assist by summarizing discussions, suggesting compromise wording, or even detecting when consensus is near. The result is that coordination costs drop dramatically – it might take only a few hours or days to get a clear sense of the group's will on an issue, something impossible to do via physical meetings or chain-of-command polling in the past.

### 4. Smart Contracts and Rule Enforcement

While we are avoiding a crypto-centric view, certain ideas from the blockchain world can be repurposed in more practical ways. For instance, the concept of smart contracts – self-executing agreements – can be applied within organizations using or not using blockchain.

Business rules and governance decisions can be encoded so that they execute automatically. Imagine a cooperative where it's encoded that if revenue exceeds X, a certain percentage automatically goes into a bonus pool for members, or that if a proposal gets 60% vote it automatically triggers implementation steps. Automation of rule enforcement ensures that agreements aren't subject to a leader's whim. This reduces the trust requirement and power concentration on individuals.

Shared digital ledgers (not necessarily public blockchains, but even an internal transparent ledger) could record all decisions, resource allocations, and votes in an immutable way, building trust among members that the system is fair and not easily manipulated behind closed doors. Essentially, automation can act as a neutral referee, executing the collective's decisions without bias.

### 5. AI-Augmented Leadership and Expertise

Rather than replace human leaders entirely, AI can augment leadership by providing decision support that counters cognitive biases and groupthink. For example, AI tools can forecast outcomes of different strategies, or highlight dissenting data points that a leadership team may overlook. This can prevent centralized leaders from making uninformed or biased decisions.

In a democratic setting, AI advisors could be available to all members: anyone could ask the system, "what are the projected impacts if we adopt Policy A vs Policy B?" and get a reasoned, data-driven analysis. This spreads expertise and reduces the reliance on "expert elite" for analysis. When everyone has access to sophisticated analysis, it levels the playing field in discussions.

In combination, these automated and digital approaches can directly tackle the four obstacles we identified:
- Power hoarding becomes less tenable when decision processes are open and many decisions are automated by agreed rules
- Information asymmetry fades when data is broadly accessible and communications bypass gatekeepers
- Coordination costs plummet with tools that let distributed groups reach decisions quickly without endless in-person debates
- Exit becomes less critical when voice is effective – people no longer need to leave to have influence, they can stay and change things through the system

It's worth noting that technology alone is not a silver bullet. Tools can be misused – e.g., AI could become a means for surveillance and tighter control if deployed in a top-down manner (some companies already use AI to micro-manage worker performance, which is dystopian). The difference in our vision is who controls the tools. The automation we speak of is in service of the members, not the bosses.

It should be implemented with strong ethical guidelines (privacy, accountability of algorithms, checks and balances). Open-source software and transparent AI models can help ensure the tools themselves are shaped by the community and continuously improved to serve the collective interest.

Early small-scale experiments give cause for optimism. For example, the ScrapeForge project – a modular web-scraping toolkit being developed by a cooperative tech community – illustrates how a distributed group can coordinate work on a complex software product. Contributors use shared repositories, AI-assisted coding, and consensus decision-making to advance the project without a traditional corporate hierarchy.

Similarly, the Fidelio initiative, a nascent cooperative experiment in open governance, is piloting the use of digital platforms for member deliberation on budget and strategy. In these initiatives, we see a blend of open digital infrastructure (like code repositories, chat forums, decision apps) and a commitment to equal say for participants, supported by automation that assigns tasks and merges contributions. They remain small-scale, but they prove out concepts that could scale up.

In summary, automation, AI, and digital tools can be harnessed to build organizations that almost run themselves – but with the important caveat that humans set the goals and rules. The promise is an organization that is highly responsive (because decisions and adjustments happen fluidly through software) while also being highly participatory (because everyone can see information and influence decisions). We are essentially talking about algorithmic governance for organizations, without ceding everything to algorithms. It's about automating away the drudgery and oligarchy, not automating away the human purpose.

## A Vision for Fully Autonomous, Human-Centric Organizations

Imagine an organization that manages itself day-to-day without top-down control, yet remains aligned with the values and needs of its human members. This is the vision of a fully autonomous, self-governing, human-serving organization. Such an organization would not rely on crypto tokens or purely blockchain-based governance (as many DAOs do), but would instead be grounded in real-world communities, legal frameworks, and technologies that we can implement today. Let's paint a picture of what this could look like, integrating the ideas discussed:

### Structure

The organization is set up as a cooperative or similar democratic entity by charter – so from the outset, every member has equal basic rights in governance (one person, one vote on fundamental issues or election of a council). There may be a constitution or bylaws encoding the mission and key values (for example, a commitment to environmental sustainability, or a cap on pay ratios). This acts like the "north star" that even the AI systems must follow. The organization's assets and resources are held in common (or via a trust structure that ensures they're used for the mission, not appropriated by individuals).

### Governance Process

Day-to-day decisions (e.g., allocating budgets, approving projects, setting policies) are made through an open proposal system. Any member can submit proposals through an online platform. Proposals might be enhanced by AI – e.g., an AI could help draft proposals in legal language or predict their outcomes.

Discussion happens in a forum where people's ideas are summarized and where AI moderation keeps debate civil and inclusive (flagging toxic language, making sure quiet voices are heard by suggesting to the group if someone's viewpoint hasn't been considered).

When ready, proposals go to a vote or consent process. Complex decisions might use liquid democracy: members who feel less informed delegate their vote to trusted peers for that specific decision, ensuring quality input without forcing everyone to decide on everything.

All voting is transparent and verified (here, blockchain or another secure ledger could be used to ensure integrity of the vote). The outcome of votes is automatically enacted by smart contracts or the organization's management AI, without requiring a boss to push it through.

### Roles and Work

People in the organization may still have different roles and expertise – autonomy doesn't mean anarchy. Teams can be self-managing, setting their own goals in line with the organization's mission. Coordination between teams is facilitated by an AI scheduler/allocator that, for instance, matches people to projects based on skills and availability, or identifies synergies between projects.

There might be no permanent CEO; instead, if leadership is needed for representation or specific tasks, it could be a role that rotates or is elected for short terms, with clearly limited powers. Alternatively, a small elected council or board exists but mainly to handle unusual cases and to interface with external legal requirements; they are fully accountable to the membership and cannot act unilaterally on major issues.

Because the operational decisions (the "executive function") are largely handled by algorithms and democratic workflows, the organization can operate 24/7, adaptive to inputs. It's "autonomous" in the sense that it doesn't require micromanagement – it has internal protocols to respond to common situations. For example, if sales drop, an automated system might put out a call to the membership for ideas to boost outreach, or automatically re-prioritize marketing spend (within limits set by policy).

### Human-Centric Design

What makes this vision human-serving is that technology is used to amplify human welfare, not to reduce people to cogs. Members collectively train the AI systems with their preferences. For instance, an AI ethics committee of members could review the algorithms for bias or misalignment. There is an emphasis on values like fairness, transparency, and sustainability in every automated process.

If the organization, say, is a cooperative factory, the autonomous scheduling AI would be programmed to respect work-life balance (not just maximize output): it might automatically ensure no one is over-scheduled, and people's individual preferences (submitted to the system) for shifts or tasks are honored as much as possible.

The organization's purpose is not profit maximization at all costs; it could be multi-stakeholder: serving workers, customers, community, and environment in a balanced way. Because it's self-governing, it can adopt multi-metric success criteria (like social impact, member happiness, quality of product) rather than just quarterly financials.

### Real-World Feasibility

This all might sound utopian, but elements of it exist today in various forms. For example, Sociocracy and Holacracy are governance methods some organizations use to distribute decision-making authority in circles and roles without a traditional hierarchy. These methods, when augmented with software, can approach the autonomous model.

Platform cooperatives (like driver-owned ride-sharing apps or community-owned Airbnb alternatives) are implementing democratic ownership of digital platforms, and some are experimenting with member voting on policies and automated profit-sharing.

The Distributed Cooperative Organization (DisCO) movement explicitly aims to blend cooperative values with distributed tech: "DisCOs are a cooperative reaction to the individualistic and techno-deterministic [DAOs]… By contrast, a Distributed Cooperative Organization prioritizes mutual support, cooperativism and care work among people."

This shows a path to keep the human element front and center even as certain operations are decentralized and automated. In a DisCO-like approach, care and community building are part of the "accounting": members might get credits not just for economic output but for mentoring others or doing administrative work – things a pure profit algorithm might ignore.

In the near future, we could see something like a "Co-op Cloud" – a suite of integrated tools that any group can use to self-organize and self-manage. It would include membership management, democratic decision modules, transparent accounting, smart contract templates, and AI assistants for various needs. With legal recognition (e.g., new cooperative legal forms that recognize AI-managed processes as valid governance), these autonomous organizations could operate in mainstream markets. They might compete with traditional companies by being more agile (thanks to AI) and more trustworthy to consumers (thanks to their ethical, transparent nature).

#### An Example Scenario:

A community forms an autonomous cooperative to provide local transportation. They pool funds to buy a fleet of self-driving electric shuttles. The routing and maintenance of vehicles is handled by AI. The pricing of rides is set by an algorithm that aims to cover costs and a reserve, but the algorithm's parameters are decided by member votes (maybe they vote to keep fares low for accessibility and subsidize with a community fund).

All residents of the community can become members by buying a share or contributing labor. They vote on major issues like expanding service or investing in more vehicles. The day-to-day service runs "itself" in the sense that requests are automatically dispatched, payments are automatic, etc., but if an issue arises (say a vehicle accident or a major complaint), a human democratic process kicks in to handle it (a randomly selected committee of members might review and make decisions, like a jury duty model).

This cooperative could offer reliable transport cheaper than a for-profit company because it has almost no management overhead and no profit extraction – everything is reinvested or returned to the community. It's accountable because all the code governing it is open to audit by members (maybe some members with IT skills volunteer to do regular audits). This is an organization serving humans, with automation taking care of the logistics.

Crucially, this vision steers away from the pitfalls seen in some DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) experiments in the crypto world. Many DAOs ended up being governed by whoever holds the most tokens (i.e. plutocracy), or they focused solely on financial speculation without real communities. Our envisioned autonomous organizations instead follow one-person-one-vote (or other egalitarian governance) and tie decision rights to actual participation and stake in the community, not to buying power. They also exist in the "real world" of providing goods and services, not just managing digital assets.

By combining the cooperative model (proven in the real world) with cutting-edge automation, we get something both practical and transformative. The benefits of such organizations would be profound: people would have true agency in economic life, not just as voters in infrequent political elections, but every day as co-creators of the enterprises they are part of. Workplaces would become extensions of our democratic values, not exceptions to them. Meanwhile, efficiency and innovation need not suffer – in fact, with diverse input and AI optimization, they could improve.

The alienation many feel at work (doing what they're told without meaning) could be replaced by a sense of ownership and purpose. And because these organizations are human-centric, they could prioritize sustainable practices and community well-being, helping address social and environmental issues that shareholder-driven firms often neglect.

Admittedly, reaching this vision will require experimentation and cultural change. People need to learn how to operate in more participatory systems, and trust the technologies that facilitate them. There will be failures and iterations. But we already see the seeds in projects around the world. As these seeds grow – the small cooperatives leveraging AI, the communities using digital tools to self-govern – they will provide templates and inspiration. Over time, autonomous, democratic organizations could become as normal as the traditional firm is today.

## Conclusion

Organizations shape much of our lives; making them more just and more effective is a project worthy of our highest aspirations. In this paper, we argued that organizations, whether companies or states, fundamentally consist of people coming together under structured rules – and that who writes and enforces those rules is the central question of justice.

Corporations today often operate as private states with authoritarian rule, but the cooperative model points toward a more democratic alternative where power resides with the people. We identified practical obstacles that have kept most organizations hierarchical, from the tendency of leaders to hoard power to the difficulty of coordinating large groups.

However, we live in an era where technology can radically alter these dynamics. AI and digital platforms, if used wisely, can distribute information, streamline coordination, and embed fairness into the very code of an organization.

The vision we put forward is bold: organizations that run autonomously, without bosses dictating terms, and yet are more aligned with human values than ever. This is not science fiction; it builds on longstanding democratic ideals and augments them with modern tools. The change is already underway in modest forms – in cooperative startups, in platform co-ops, in community-run projects leveraging the internet. By learning from these and scaling them up, we can reimagine companies not as feudal fiefdoms or faceless machines, but as responsive, living systems governed by the people for the people.

Realizing this vision will require perseverance. There will be resistance from those comfortable with the old ways, and there will be technical and organizational hurdles. But the potential rewards – a more empowered workforce, more resilient and innovative businesses, and a society where our daily economic life reflects our democratic ideals – are well worth the effort.

In essence, we have the chance to automate away the oppression and drudgery, while amplifying the creative and consensual. The question, "What are organizations and how to automate them?" leads to an exciting answer: we can transform organizations into self-governing entities that serve humanity, by marrying cooperative principles with intelligent automation.

Such a transformation would represent a new chapter in the story of human organization – one in which technology and governance co-evolve to elevate freedom, equality, and participation. It moves us closer to a world where every organization, large or small, can truly say it operates "of the people, by the people, for the people." With imagination and determination, that world is within our reach.
